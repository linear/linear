**WARNING**: The CLI and SDK in this repository are not up to date. For now we recommend everyone to use the Linear GraphQL API directly. For a reference client implementation, check out the [linear-import](https://github.com/linearapp/linear-import) repository.

This monorepo contains tools and documentation for Linear's API.
