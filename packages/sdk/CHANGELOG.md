### Major Changes

- 8f7ef89: Removed support for calling LinearClient::request with GraphQL document nodes

  `LinearClient::request` allows for raw access to Linear's GraphQL API. Previously this method would be called with either
  a GraphQL query string, or a document node object. We are removing support for calling this with a document node to
  remove the SDK's runtime dependency on the `graphql-js` library. If you were previously using this functionality, the
  migration is straightforward. Before calling `request`, stringify your document node using the
  [`print`](https://www.graphql-js.org/api-v16/language/#print) function from `graphql-js`:

  **Before:**

  ```ts
  import { DocumentNode } from "graphql";

  const documentNode: DocumentNode = {
